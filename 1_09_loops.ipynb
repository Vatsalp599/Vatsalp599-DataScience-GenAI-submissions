On a new line, we indent the code we wish to run repeatedly, which is to print the count.

It’s important that you try to avoid infinite loops as, if uninterrupted, your system still eventually crash. When stuck in an infinite loop, you can just interrupt it by pressing the stop button in your Jupyter Notebook."
